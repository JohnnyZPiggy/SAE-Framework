## Research-first scientific workflow amendment (2026-10-18)

- GPT Scientific Mentor now leads **pre-engineering mathematical structure discovery and tensorization research** (matvec, matrix-free operators, batched tensor contractions and non-parallelizable barriers).
- Scientist reviews a `RESEARCH_READY` / `RESEARCH_BLOCKED` / `NOT_TENSORIZABLE` mathematical study before Architect specifies algorithm implementation tasks or formal GPU benchmarks.
- New bilingual research workflow, template and GitHub Issue forms; architecture diagrams and bootstrap/role/task protocols updated.
- Downstream CPU/GPU findings can iterate back to structure discovery; no automatic speedup claims.
- Project config example adds a `research_gate` section. Existing deployments should explicitly update their **pinned framework snapshot**.

## Framework V3.2 — Initial public protocol package
- Two equal objectives: **Engineering Productivity** and **Scientific Learning**.
- GPT serves as **Chief Architect** and **Scientific Mentor**.
- Codex owns Python modules, CPU testing, benchmarks and PR engineering.
- Human Scientist operates Colab and holds scientific authority.
- GitHub Issues, PRs and compact GPU reports are the shared coordination and evidence center.
- Google Drive is an optional small Colab workspace, never a sync layer.
- No GitHub Actions/paid hosted CI; thin Notebooks; no unverified execution claims.
- Role commands, safe bootstrap, review/publish handoffs, templates and project config included.

**Compatibility note:** V3.2 is the architecture label, not a guarantee that an autonomous runner or a GPU publisher binary already exists. Project integrations must be implemented and validated separately.
